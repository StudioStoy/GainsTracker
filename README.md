## Releases
Releases follow a specific versioning naming system. For example: `v0.1.0-alpha-api`. Which means the following:

- `v`: Version
- `0.1.0`: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- `-alpha`: Indicate the release is an pre-release version
- `-api`: Indicates the release contains the API functionality, but not yet in the UI logic for it. If there's no `-api` suffix, the release contains both the API and UI logic for that release.
